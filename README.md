# Adaptive Riemannian Geometry Classifiers

## Description
This repository contains the MATLAB scipts of adaptive riemannian geometry classifiers proposed in [1]. 
The proposed methods deals with the adaptaion of riemannian geometry based classifiers to tackle the drifts occuring in the data across the session. 
We proposed different techniques based on REBIAS, RETRAIN and hybrid REBIAS-RETRAIN adaptation strategies to adapt the MDM and FgMDM classifier as proposed in [2]. 
Note that the proposed approaches can also be used for adapatation in across subject transfer learning scenarios
